POST MORTUM

A post-mortem report enables you to document important findings and put issues and ideas into accountable action.

1. List out any issues and ideas discussed in your post-mortem meeting.
2. Write down potential solutions for each issue and idea.
3. Add action items for each issue, idea, or solution.
4. Capture additional details as notes.

8 ground rules for project post-mortem meetings

Before you jump in, it’s very important to remember these meetings are meant to discuss issues openly without creating a negative working environment. There’s a fine line between discussing issues and complaining about them.

In order to make any progress, you need to talk freely and openly (not negatively) about how you can improve your process and, as a result, your work. To ensure this happens, set and discuss some basic ground rules for your project's post-mortem meeting:

    1. Bring in a facilitator to guide the meeting. As the project manager, this doesn’t need to be you.
    If you were part of the project team, you should participate in the meeting. If you can’t get someone to fill
    this role in the meeting, make facilitation a team effort.
    2. Keep it light. This is a learning session and should be fun.
    Kick it off by discussing the positives and celebrating your successes.
    3. Be constructive, not destructive. State the issue, and focus on the solution.
    Identify where the process works and where it breaks down.
    4. Don’t get personal. This isn’t about placing blame or finger-pointing.
    You’re there to discuss challenges and resolve issues, so keep it high-level.
    If a problem was about a person, that should have been discussed with that person’s supervisor.
    5. Cover all your bases. Figure out what made the project simple, difficult, enjoyable, or miserable.
    6. Be respectful of one another’s point of view. Everyone has equal footing in this meeting.
    That means no one should dominate the conversation. Give every team member a chance to share their perspective.
    7. Take notes. It’s not important to capture every detail, as much as the issue, the solution, action items,
    and who owns each line item. You may also want to keep track of new ideas so your team has a roadmap for process improvement.
    8. Abide by the meeting goal. Make it a point to leave with a set of action items and owners.

It's basically a group effort to make changes. We need to find a way to share the project's post-mortem report.
However, the majority of our team chose to write everything down in person.
